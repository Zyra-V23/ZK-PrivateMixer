# Task ID: 9
# Title: Research RISC Zero SDK and Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Investigate the RISC Zero zkVM, Rust SDK, and Ethereum integration.
# Details:
1. Review RISC Zero documentation (risczero.com/docs). 2. Explore the Rust SDK and example projects (github.com/risc0). 3. Understand the process of writing, proving, and verifying Rust code using the zkVM. 4. Investigate the `risc0-ethereum` tooling for on-chain verification (Bonsai Network, verifier contracts). 5. Assess the feasibility of implementing the mixer logic in Rust/RISC Zero.

# Test Strategy:
Produce a summary document outlining RISC Zero's architecture, development workflow, Ethereum integration options, and potential challenges/benefits for the Uzumaki vision.
