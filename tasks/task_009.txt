# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Security and Privacy Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Add additional security and privacy features to strengthen the ZK Mixer implementation.
# Details:
Implement additional security and privacy enhancements for the ZK Mixer. Add timing protection for web interactions to prevent timing attacks. Implement secure random number generation with entropy gathering. Add browser fingerprinting protection mechanisms. Improve gas efficiency for contract interactions. Create secure connection handling with blockchain nodes. Implement multiple deposit denominations if gas-efficient. Add contract upgradeability with secure governance.

# Test Strategy:
Test security enhancements against common attack vectors. Verify random number generation quality. Test gas consumption for different operations. Validate upgradeability mechanisms. Review security practices with standard audit techniques.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Adapt Project Rules for Security Enhancements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review existing project rules and adapt or create new rules related to security best practices, privacy protections, and secure cryptographic implementations.
### Details:
Focus on rules for timing attack prevention, secure RNG, browser security, and contract security patterns.
