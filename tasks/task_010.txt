# Title: Prototype Mixer Logic in Rust/RISC Zero
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a proof-of-concept implementation of the core mixer logic (commitment, nullifier, Merkle proof verification) in Rust using the RISC Zero SDK.
# Details:
1. Set up a Rust development environment with the RISC Zero toolchain. 2. Implement cryptographic primitives (Poseidon hash - potentially using existing Rust crates, Merkle tree logic) compatible with the zkVM. 3. Write guest code (Rust) that performs the mixer verification steps (e.g., checks Merkle proof, validates nullifier hash). 4. Implement host code to run the guest, generate proofs, and potentially verify them.

# Test Strategy:
Successfully compile and run the Rust guest code within the zkVM. Generate a valid ZK proof (receipt) for a simulated withdrawal scenario. Verify the proof using RISC Zero tools.
