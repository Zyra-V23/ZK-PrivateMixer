# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Ethereum ZK-SNARK Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a complete zero-knowledge proof system for the ZK Mixer to enable private transactions on Ethereum.
# Details:
Enhance the ZK circuit and smart contract implementation with optimized zk-SNARKs for Ethereum. Finalize the Merkle tree implementation for efficient verification. Implement efficient verification on-chain to minimize gas costs. Add support for the fixed denomination mixing (e.g., 0.1 ETH) with proper commitment and nullifier handling. Create comprehensive tests for the zk-SNARK implementation. Document the cryptographic primitives and security model. Implement proper proof generation and validation with optimized circuits.

# Test Strategy:
Test proof generation and verification for various scenarios. Validate Merkle tree implementation. Perform gas optimization tests for on-chain verification. Verify security properties through analysis of the system. Test against common attack vectors for ZK mixer applications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Adapt Project Rules for Ethereum ZK Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review existing project rules and adapt or create new rules specific to Solidity smart contracts, Circom circuits, zk-SNARKs, gas optimization, and proof verification.
### Details:
Focus on rules for secure Solidity development, Circom coding standards, proof generation/verification, anonymity set considerations, and gas efficiency patterns.
