# Task ID: 8
# Title: Refactor Codebase with U-ZK Void Thematic Naming
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Rename contracts, functions, variables, events, and comments across Solidity, frontend, tests, and scripts to align with the Uzumaki/Void aesthetic.
# Details:
Refactor codebase incorporating thematic names like `VoidMixer`, `enterVoid`, `emergeFromVoid`, `voidSigil`, `voidEcho`, `spiralMark`, etc. Scope includes: Solidity contracts (.sol), frontend interaction code (JS/TS), contract ABIs, tests (.cjs), deployment/utility scripts (.js), and documentation/comments. Requires careful updating of all references and ABIs.

# Test Strategy:
Ensure all existing tests pass after refactoring. Verify UI interactions work correctly with updated contract names and ABIs. Manually review code for consistent thematic naming.
