# Task ID: 17
# Title: Prototype and test Light Protocol-based ZK workflow on Solana
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a working prototype using Light Protocol to demonstrate ZK proof generation and verification on Solana. Test the privacy workflow end-to-end.
# Details:
Implement a minimal ZK workflow (e.g., deposit, proof, withdraw) using Light Protocol. Run integration tests and document results.

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end test: user can generate a ZK proof, submit it to Solana, and have it verified using Light Protocol. All steps are documented.
