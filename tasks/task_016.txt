# Task ID: 16
# Title: Integrate Light Protocol for ZK on Solana
# Status: inprogress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Research, integrate, and experiment with Light Protocol to enable ZK circuits, proofs, and verifiers natively on Solana. Focus on understanding and leveraging Light Protocol's primitives, SDKs, and documentation.
# Details:
Study Light Protocol's architecture and documentation. Set up the development environment. Prepare for prototyping and integration of ZK workflows on Solana.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that ZK circuits and proofs can be generated and verified using Light Protocol on Solana. Document all findings and blockers.
