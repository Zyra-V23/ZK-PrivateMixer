# Task ID: 6
# Title: Deploy ZK-PrivateMixer to Testnet (Sepolia)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: critical
# Description: Deploy the functional ZK-PrivateMixer contracts and basic UI to the Sepolia testnet.
# Details:
1. Configure Hardhat for Sepolia deployment (RPC URL, private key via .env). 2. Write/refine deployment scripts in `/scripts` for `ZKMixer.sol`, `Verifier.sol`, and `PoseidonT3.sol`. 3. Ensure scripts handle library linking correctly. 4. Perform deployment to Sepolia. 5. Verify contract interactions on Sepolia Etherscan. 6. Configure frontend environment variables (`.env`) with deployed Sepolia contract addresses. 7. Deploy frontend build (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) connected to Sepolia.

# Test Strategy:
Perform successful deployment. Test deposit and withdrawal flow end-to-end on Sepolia via the deployed UI. Verify transactions and contract state on Sepolia Etherscan.
