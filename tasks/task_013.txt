# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Enhanced Mixer Circuit with Sparse Merkle Tree Verification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 11, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and integrate a complete mixer.circom circuit with Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) verification to replace the simple multiplier circuit.
# Details:
Build upon the established ZK workflow to create a fully functional mixer circuit with SMT verification capabilities. Implement the circuit incrementally, starting with basic components and progressively adding more complex functionality. Ensure cryptographic correctness and integration with the existing smart contract infrastructure. This task transitions the project from the simplified multiplier circuit to a production-ready privacy solution.

# Test Strategy:
Test each component incrementally with carefully crafted inputs. Verify circuit constraints with both valid and invalid inputs. Confirm integration with smart contracts through end-to-end tests. Measure performance metrics including constraint count and proving time.
