# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup ZK Mixer Core Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the foundational architecture for the ZK Mixer prototype, including smart contracts, ZK circuit, and web interface.
# Details:
Create a web-based architecture for a simple ZK Mixer. Set up a project with Solidity smart contracts, Circom circuits for ZK proofs, and a React-based web interface. Configure development environment with Hardhat. Implement the project structure with clear separation between contracts, circuits, and frontend. Set up testing environment for smart contracts and circuits. Include configuration for different networks (local, testnet, mainnet). Establish coding standards and documentation templates.

# Test Strategy:
Validate contracts compile and deploy successfully. Verify circuit generation and proof verification. Test frontend interaction with contracts. Perform code quality checks using static analysis tools.
