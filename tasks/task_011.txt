# Task ID: 11
# Title: Compare Groth16 vs. RISC Zero Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze and compare the performance characteristics (proving time, proof size, verification cost/complexity) of the current Circom/Groth16 implementation vs. the RISC Zero prototype.
# Details:
1. Measure proving time for the Circom circuit on standard hardware. 2. Record proof size for Groth16. 3. Estimate/measure on-chain verification gas cost for `Verifier.sol`. 4. Measure proving time for the RISC Zero Rust prototype. 5. Record proof size (receipt size) for RISC Zero. 6. Estimate/measure on-chain verification cost for RISC Zero proofs (using Bonsai or direct verifier). 7. Document findings in a comparative analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Create a report comparing key metrics (proving time, proof size, verification cost, development complexity) for both approaches in the context of the mixer application.
