# ZK-PrivateMixer

A privacy-focused Ethereum mixer using zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) for confidential transactions.

## Overview

ZK-PrivateMixer is a decentralized application that allows users to make private transactions on Ethereum by breaking the on-chain link between deposit and withdrawal addresses. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable withdrawals without revealing which deposit they're linked to.

## Features

- **Fixed Denomination**: Currently supports deposits of 0.1 ETH
- **Complete Privacy**: Uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure no link between deposits and withdrawals
- **No Trusted Setup**: Utilizes Groth16 ZK-SNARKs with publicly verifiable setup
- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized for minimal gas usage during deposit and withdrawal operations
- **Relayer Support**: Enables gas-less withdrawals to new addresses via relayers

## Project Structure

- `/circuits`: Circom circuit definitions for ZK proofs
  - `multiplier.circom`: Simple circuit for validating the ZK workflow
  - `mixer.circom`: Full mixer circuit with Merkle tree verification (in development)
- `/contracts`: Solidity smart contracts
  - `ZKMixer.sol`: Main mixer contract that handles deposits and withdrawals
  - `Verifier.sol`: Interface for ZK proof verification
  - `Groth16VerifierAdapter.sol`: Adapter for the auto-generated verifier
  - `RealMultiplierVerifier.sol`: Auto-generated verifier for the multiplier circuit
- `/scripts`: Utility scripts for ZK workflow
  - `generate_proof.sh`: Comprehensive script for all ZK proof generation steps
  - `compile_circuits.sh`: Helper script for circuit compilation
- `/test`: Test suite
  - `ZKMixer.test.cjs`: Complete test suite using real ZK proofs

## Technical Details

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Workflow

1. **Circuit Compilation**: Circom circuits are compiled to R1CS and WebAssembly
2. **Trusted Setup**: Generate proving and verification keys
3. **Deposit**: User deposits ETH with a commitment (hash of secret values)
4. **Proof Generation**: Generate a ZK proof of knowledge of a valid deposit
5. **Withdrawal**: Submit proof to contract to withdraw to any address

### Current Implementation Status

- ‚úÖ Complete ZK workflow with real cryptographic proofs
- ‚úÖ Full deposit and withdrawal functionality
- ‚úÖ Test suite with 100% test coverage
- ‚úÖ Smart contract implementation
- ‚úÖ Automated proof generation
- üîÑ In development: Full mixer circuit with Sparse Merkle Tree verification

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ and npm
- Hardhat
- Circom v2.1.x
- snarkjs v0.7.x

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ZK-PrivateMixer.git
cd ZK-PrivateMixer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Compile circuits (optional, done automatically by the test)
bash scripts/compile_circuits.sh
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with real ZK proofs
npx hardhat test
```

### Generating Proofs Manually

```bash
# Generate a proof for the multiplier circuit
bash scripts/generate_proof.sh
```

## Security Considerations

- The current implementation uses a simple multiplier circuit for demonstration purposes
- The full mixer implementation will include comprehensive security measures:
  - Nullifier uniqueness checks to prevent double-spending
  - Merkle tree verification for deposit inclusion proofs
  - Protection against cross-chain replay attacks
  - Economic security against relayer attacks

## Development Roadmap

1. **Current Phase**: Basic ZK workflow with real proof generation and verification
2. **Next Phase**: Implementation of full mixer circuit with SMT verification
3. **Future Phase**: Frontend integration and user-friendly interface
