# ZK Mixer - Circuit Analysis & Development Notes

## Overview

This document captures key findings, challenges, and solutions encountered during the development of the ZK Mixer circuit components, particularly focusing on the Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) implementation and zero-knowledge proof workflow.

## Circuit Architecture

The ZK Mixer core functionality is implemented using Circom 2.0 circuits with the following key components:

1. **Main Mixer Circuit (`mixer.circom`)**: Validates that a user knows the preimage to a commitment in a Merkle tree and generates a nullifier hash correctly, without revealing the commitment or preimage.

2. **Cryptographic Components**:
   - **Poseidon Hash**: Used for commitment and nullifier hash calculations
   - **SMTVerifier**: Used for Sparse Merkle Tree inclusion proofs

3. **Key Circuit Signals**:
   - **Private inputs**: `secret`, `nullifier`, `pathElements`, `pathIndices`
   - **Public inputs**: `root`, `nullifierHash`, `recipient`, `relayer`, `fee`, `chainId`, `refund`

## Dual Circuit Implementation Strategy

To manage complexity and ensure reliable ZK proof workflow implementation, we've adopted a dual circuit approach:

1. **Simple Circuit (`multiplier.circom`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Acts as a minimal viable implementation to validate the complete ZK workflow
   - **Implementation**: A basic multiplier circuit (a × b = c) with minimal constraints
   - **Workflow**: Has its own complete build process, inputs, and Solidity verifier
   - **Artifacts**: Dedicated build files in `circuits/build/multiplier` and the `Groth16Verifier.sol` contract
   - **Inputs**: Simple input with just two values (a and b)

2. **Complex Mixer Circuit (`mixer.circom`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Implements the actual ZK mixer functionality with SMT verification
   - **Implementation**: Full cryptographic implementation using Poseidon and SMTVerifier
   - **Workflow**: More complex build process requiring specific input generation
   - **Artifacts**: Larger build files and corresponding verifier contract
   - **Inputs**: Multiple input variants for different testing scenarios

3. **Benefits of this approach**:
   - **Progressive Testing**: Allows us to verify the entire ZK workflow with a simple circuit before tackling the more complex one
   - **Isolated Debugging**: When issues arise, we can determine if they are related to the ZK workflow itself or to the specific circuit logic
   - **Learning Tool**: Serves as a clear example for understanding the minimal requirements of a functional ZK circuit
   - **Benchmark Comparison**: Provides insight into the constraint and performance differences between simple and complex implementations
   - **Fallback Option**: If the complex circuit encounters persistent issues, we still have a functional ZK workflow to demonstrate the concept

4. **Implementation Note**: Both circuits follow the same workflow steps (compilation, setup, proof generation, verification) but with different complexity levels, allowing for focused troubleshooting of each step in the process.

## Mixer Circuit Constraint Analysis

Based on our most recent compilation, the `mixer.circom` circuit now has the following constraints:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Template instances | 161 |
| Non-linear constraints | 7,156 |
| Linear constraints | 6,979 |
| Total constraints | 14,135 |
| Public inputs | 7 |
| Private inputs | 42 (22 belong to witness) |
| Public outputs | 0 |
| Wires | 14,152 |
| Labels | 22,529 |

### Key Circuit Constraints

The constraints in the mixer circuit serve the following purposes:

1. **Commitment Verification**: Ensures the commitment is correctly calculated from secret and nullifier
2. **Nullifier Hash Verification**: Validates that the nullifierHash is correctly derived from nullifier, recipient, and chainId
3. **Merkle Path Verification**: Ensures the commitment is part of the Merkle tree with the given root
4. **Economic Security**: Ensures fee is less than or equal to refund
5. **Input Validation**: Ensures secret and nullifier are non-zero

The total constraint count of 14,135 is reasonable for a ZK circuit of this complexity, especially considering that a single Poseidon hash operation typically requires ~500-700 constraints, and a full SMT verification (20 levels) requires thousands of constraints.

## SMTVerifier Analysis

### Core Requirements

The `SMTVerifier` component, which is central to our Merkle tree proof validation, has specific requirements that must be followed:

1. **Path Structure Requirements**:
   - The **last sibling** in the path array **MUST be zero** (`pathElements[nLevels-1] === 0`)
   - At least one **earlier sibling** (typically the second-to-last) **must be non-zero**
   - This is enforced by assertion in line 92 of `SMTVerifier.circom`

2. **Key Relationships**:
   - For inclusion proofs where the key was not previously in the tree, set `isOld0 = 1`
   - For other operations, ensure the relationship between `key`, `oldKey`, and `isOld0` follows the expected pattern
   - Errors in these relationships can cause constraint failures in line 92 of `SMTVerifier.circom`

### Common Issues

1. **Witness Generation Failures**:
   - Most common error: `Assert Failed. Error in template SMTVerifier_157 line: 92`
   - Caused by invalid path construction, especially when all siblings are zero or the last sibling is non-zero
   - Also happens when the nullifierHash doesn't match the actual Poseidon hash of nullifier and recipient

2. **Hash Consistency**:
   - The nullifierHash must be calculated using the same Poseidon implementation in both:
     - The circuit (internal constraint: `nullifierHash === nullifierHasher.out`)
     - The input generation script
   - Any mismatch will cause constraint failures

### SMT Circuit Implementation

Our mixer circuit correctly implements SMT verification by using the `SMTVerifier` component from circomlib with the following configuration:

```circom
component merkleProof = SMTVerifier(levels);
merkleProof.enabled <== 1;       // Enable the verifier
merkleProof.fnc <== 0;           // Function code 0 for inclusion proof
merkleProof.root <== root;       // Public root
merkleProof.key <== commitment;  // The leaf (commitment) we are proving inclusion for
merkleProof.value <== 1;         // Assuming value 1 indicates inclusion
merkleProof.oldKey <== 0;        // Dummy value for inclusion proof
merkleProof.oldValue <== 0;      // Dummy value for inclusion proof
merkleProof.isOld0 <== 1;        // Indicates the old leaf was 0 (necessary for inclusion proof logic in SMT)
```

The circuit contains all the necessary security constraints to ensure:
1. ✅ **Privacy**: Keeps secret and nullifier private while proving commitment inclusion
2. ✅ **Security**: Prevents double spending through nullifierHash
3. ✅ **Anti-Replay**: Prevents cross-chain replay attacks using chainId
4. ✅ **Economic Security**: Ensures relayer fees don't exceed refunds

## SMT Verification Test Vector

To facilitate testing, we've developed a standard test vector that meets the specific requirements for SMT verification. For a simplified 4-level tree example:

```javascript
{
  // Private inputs
  "secret": "123456789",
  "nullifier": "987654321",
  
  // SMT path 
  "pathElements": [
    "12897408908614754831623152735547858816", // level 0 - non-zero
    "7853678147568965412587412536547895123",  // level 1 - non-zero
    "18745632587410258963214785632589651236", // level 2 - non-zero (second-to-last)
    "0"                                       // level 3 - zero (last level)
  ],
  "pathIndices": [1, 0, 1, 0],  // Path directions (right, left, right, left)
  
  // Public inputs
  "root": "15681236781923761230876423157689632145", // Expected Merkle root
  "nullifierHash": "21547896321458961237965847120365478921", // Expected nullifierHash
  "recipient": "0xabc123...",
  "relayer": "0x0000000...",
  "fee": "0",
  "chainId": "1",
  "refund": "0"
}
```

This test vector adheres to all critical requirements:
- Last sibling is zero: ✅ `pathElements[3] = 0`
- Second-to-last sibling is non-zero: ✅ `pathElements[2] ≠ 0`

## Input Generation Strategy

After extensive testing, we've developed a robust strategy for generating valid inputs:

```javascript
// Key components of a proper input generation script:
async function generateInputs() {
    // 1. Initialize cryptographic functions
    const poseidon = await buildPoseidon();
    const poseidonHash = (inputs) => { /* implementation */ };
    
    // 2. Generate random values
    const nullifier = generateRandomBigInt();
    const secret = generateRandomBigInt();
    
    // 3. Calculate commitment
    const commitment = poseidonHash([nullifier, secret]);
    
    // 4. Create valid SMT path:
    // - Last sibling MUST be zero
    // - At least one earlier sibling must be non-zero
    const siblings = new Array(MERKLE_TREE_HEIGHT).fill(BigInt(0));
    siblings[MERKLE_TREE_HEIGHT - 2] = generateRandomBigInt(); // Make second-to-last non-zero
    
    // 5. Calculate root based on commitment and path
    let currentHash = commitment;
    for (let i = MERKLE_TREE_HEIGHT - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        currentHash = poseidonHash([currentHash, siblings[i]]);
    }
    const root = currentHash;
    
    // 6. Calculate nullifierHash using EXACTLY the same logic as in the circuit
    const recipient = generateRandomBigInt();
    const nullifierHash = poseidonHash([nullifier, recipient]);
    
    // 7. Format and save inputs
    const circuitInputs = {
        // Private inputs
        secret: secret.toString(),
        nullifier: nullifier.toString(),
        pathElements: siblings.map(s => s.toString()),
        pathIndices: new Array(MERKLE_TREE_HEIGHT).fill("0"),
        
        // Public inputs
        root: root.toString(),
        nullifierHash: nullifierHash.toString(),
        recipient: recipient.toString(),
        relayer: "0", // Default values for enhanced mixer
        fee: "0",
        chainId: "1",
        refund: "0"
    };
    
    return circuitInputs;
}
```

## Updated Proof Generation Workflow

We've enhanced our proof generation workflow to support both the simple multiplier circuit and the full mixer circuit with SMT verification. The workflow now consists of two main scripts:

### 1. `generate_mixer_inputs.js`

This script generates cryptographically valid inputs for the mixer circuit, respecting all SMT-specific requirements.

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/generate_mixer_inputs.js
```

### 2. `generate_proof.sh`

This updated script handles the full proof generation workflow for any circuit in the project.

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/generate_proof.sh <circuit_name> [input_file]
```

For example:
```bash
# Generate proof for multiplier circuit (using default input)
./scripts/generate_proof.sh multiplier

# Generate proof for mixer circuit (using input file generated above)
./scripts/generate_proof.sh mixer inputs/mixer_input.json
```

The script performs the following steps:
1. Compiles the specified circuit
2. Generates Powers of Tau file (if needed)
3. Generates the zkey and verification key
4. Creates a Solidity verifier contract
5. Calculates the witness
6. Generates and verifies the proof
7. Exports calldata for on-chain verification

### Key Workflow Enhancements

Our updated workflow includes several improvements:

1. **Circuit Flexibility**: The script now works with both simple and complex circuits
2. **Parameter Adaptability**: Powers of Tau parameters automatically adjust to circuit complexity
3. **Input Handling**: Supports flexible input sources with proper error handling
4. **Output Organization**: Keeps outputs organized in circuit-specific build directories

## Workflow Recommendations

1. **Progressive Testing**:
   - Start with a simple circuit (e.g., a basic multiplier) before tackling the full mixer
   - Verify each step in the ZK workflow independently
   - Use small, easily traceable values for initial testing

2. **File Organization**:
   - Store all circuit inputs in the `/inputs` directory
   - Use descriptive filenames: `simple_input.json`, `debug_input.json`, `production_input.json`, etc.
   - Add sensitive inputs to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure

3. **Debugging Techniques**:
   - Use the `.sym` file to map constraint failures to specific lines in the circuit
   - Add detailed console logging in input generation scripts
   - Try simplifying the circuit temporarily to isolate issues

## Powers of Tau File Analysis

The Powers of Tau file (`powersOfTau28_hez_final_15.ptau`) used in our setup:

- **Expected size**: ~36 MB for 2^15 constraints
- **Source**: Should be downloaded from trusted sources (Hermez ceremony)
- **Security**: Never generate Powers of Tau files locally for production use

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

1. **Circuit Development**:
   - Always start with the simplest implementation and add complexity incrementally
   - Maintain separation between cryptographic and business logic when possible
   - Test each component individually before integration

2. **Input Generation**:
   - Always calculate hashes using the actual implementation, not placeholder values
   - Ensure cryptographic consistency between all components of the input
   - Pay special attention to special requirements like the SMT sibling pattern

3. **Workflow Automation**:
   - Create script files for each major step in the ZK workflow
   - Maintain separate scripts for development, testing, and production
   - Document command parameters clearly
